# MaxHS
A compiler for the MaxHs language for Maxeler Dataflow engines

Developed as part of my [BSc Thesis](https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=72388&lang=eng) (in Slovene).

An overview article was published at the [ERK 2015 conference in Slovenia](https://erk.fe.uni-lj.si/2015/program.php). A copy of the article is available [here](https://github.com/xnevs/MaxHs/blob/master/cerk(on_compiling)p.pdf).
